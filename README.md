# üìù Mike Todo

**Mike Todo** is a simple task management application _todolist style_, built with **Angular 10** and **Angular Material**. It features a **dark/light mode**, task filtering, and persistence using **local storage**. The project was developed as a quick challenge, prioritizing **functionality and design**, while also demonstrating **best practices in RxJS, services, modularization and scalability**.

## Live Demo/CI

## Final considerations

The project was intentionally developed with a focused scope, given the timeframe. Further suggested increments

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

- **Pagination and localStorage** - Add pagination for better task management when dealing with large lists; At the same time, localStorage serves as an example, however I'd not rely on it;
- **Theme Standardization** - Improve consistency in Material Theme customization and create a well-structured theming system;
- **More Tests** - Increase test coverage, particularly for UI interactions and edge cases;
- **GitHub Actions for CI/CD** - Automate builds and deployments to Netlify for a seamless development workflow;

Happy to elaborate! :)
